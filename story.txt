There once was a cat named Jerry. 
He was so sad because of Bobby
who left him alone in the house.
But Bobby returned
Much to Jerry's sempiternal delight
And thus all reedemed
In the eye all cat owners
In the world.
But there were cats beyond the known world, who waited still alone. 
And, thus, Bobby went out in a spaceship to rescue ALL THE CATZ.
